Determine AI Strategy and Difficulty Levels
AI Strategy:
Beginner: Simple, random moves focusing on basic principles.
Intermediate: Minimax with a depth of 3-4.
Advanced: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning, depth of 6-8.
Expert: Neural networks or advanced algorithms simulating top-level play

Logic Implementation:

Move Generation: Generate all possible legal moves from a given board position using a predefined set of rules for chess.
Move Evaluation: Evaluate the strength of each move based on material value, control of the board, and other heuristics.
Search Tree: Implement the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to explore possible moves and their outcomes.
Training and Tuning: For advanced levels, employ neural networks trained on datasets of professional games
