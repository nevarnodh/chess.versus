#### 3. Determine AI Strategy and Difficulty Levels
**AI Strategy:**
- **Beginner:** Random move selection with basic opening principles.
- **Intermediate:** Minimax algorithm with a depth of 3-4 moves ahead.
- **Advanced:** Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, evaluating 6-8 moves ahead.
- **Expert:** Advanced algorithms using neural networks or pre-trained models from databases of high-level games.

**Difficulty Levels:**
1. **Easy:** AI makes random or near-random moves, focusing more on allowing new players to learn and explore.
2. **Medium:** AI uses basic opening principles and calculates moves a few steps ahead.
3. **Hard:** AI employs the minimax algorithm with a significant depth, challenging even skilled players.
4. **Expert:** AI uses advanced techniques and has access to a large database of professional games to simulate high-level play.

#### 4. Plan AI Algorithms and Logic
**AI Algorithms:**
- **Minimax Algorithm:** 
  - A decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.
  - Evaluate positions by assuming both players play optimally.
  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** 
  - An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm.
  - Reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.

- **Neural Networks/Deep Learning:** 
  - Advanced AI uses neural networks trained on large datasets of chess games.
  - Implement pre-trained models like those used in AlphaZero.

**Logic Implementation:**
- **Move Generation:** Generate all possible legal moves from a given board position.
- **Move Evaluation:** Evaluate the potential moves using a scoring function based on material count, board control, and other heuristics.
- **Search Tree:** Implement the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to explore possible moves and counter-moves.
- **Training and Tuning:** For advanced AI levels, utilize neural networks and continuously train the model with new data.

By the end of Week 1, we should have:
- Clearly defined roles and objectives of the game.
- Wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
- A detailed plan for AI strategies and difficulty levels.
- Initial algorithms and logic for AI move generation and evaluation.

This foundational work will guide the development process and ensure a structured approach to building Chess.Versus.

Creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for Chess.Versus involves implementing the core functionality of the game with the most essential features. Here's a list of additional code files and snippets that should be included, along with further details to help build the MVP.

1. Project Structure
To maintain a clean and organized codebase, structure the project as follows:
Chess.Versus/
│
├── assets/
│   └── images/          # For storing images (avatars, logos, etc.)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css       # Main CSS file for styling
├── js/
│   ├── main.js          # Main JavaScript file for UI interactions
│   ├── chessboard.js    # Logic for rendering the chessboard
│   └── ai.js            # AI algorithms and logic
├── index.html           # Home page
├── login.html           # Login page
├── register.html        # Registration page
├── profile.html         # Profile page
├── lobby.html           # Game lobby
├── game.html            # Chessboard/game screen
└── history.html         # Game history page

2. Backend Setup
Since the MVP should allow for user registration, login, and basic game functionalities, we need to consider a simple backend. Below is an outline of essential backend components:

Backend Framework: Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js) for simplicity.
Database: SQLite for easy setup, or MySQL/PostgreSQL if you plan to scale later.
3. Additional Code Files and Snippets
1. Database Setup
You'll need a database to handle user accounts, game history, and other persistent data
